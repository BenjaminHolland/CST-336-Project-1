As a villain, I wanted to find some affordable henchmen so through the Villian webpage I was able to do that by going to the products page and sorting the products on the site by "Henchmen" and I got a list of the various types of henchmen available. I found the ones right for me through the descriptions given for each type of henchmen and I added the quantity I wanted to my shopping cart through a text box that took a value.
Looking for uranium I stumbled upon the Villian webpage and was able to find what I needed through the sort by "raw material" on the products page. I was happy to see that I was able to put all the uranium I wanted in my cart but after I was still able to sort the page again in order to find other miscellaneous items that I wanted.
While looking for particular types of elemental weapons for my henchmen I liked the fact that the Villian webpage was able to sort all the products by "Weapons" but my time would have been shortened if there was a sub sort list that allowed me to pick what type of weapon I wanted such as a freezing based one.
